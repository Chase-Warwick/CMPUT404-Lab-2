1. How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?
	The command to specify a TCP socket in Python through
	the socket module is
	
	socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

2. What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?	I think that the difference between a client socket and a server
	socket is that the client socket takes actions while the
	server socket seems to wait and respond to client socket actions
	
	They seem to be instantiated in a similar manner but in the
	client program the client socket sends a payload and initiates
	the interaction

	The server client in contrast binds to a HOST and a PORT and
	listens for a client to ask for data. It then sends this data
	to the client

3. How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?
	Using a SO_REUSEADDR instructs the OS to let us reuse the same
	bind port

4. What information do we get about incoming connections?
	The IP and the port are recieved from incoming connections

5. What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
	
	Data which is returned from the HTTP request is received upon calling
	recv(). In the case of this program it includes but is not limited
	to the source of the google.com page as well as a status code.
